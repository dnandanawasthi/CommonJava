This solution intend to design a model for the following game using OOP principles:
There is a set of characters and a set of different weapons that the players can use in the
game. Each character can make use of one weapon at a time but can change weapons at
any time during the game.
Characters: Rick, Michonne, Negan and Daryl.
Weapons: Baseball Bat wrapped in Barb Wire, Bow-and-Arrow, Revolver and Katana.
Explain all the decisions made on design (where and why would you OOP principles).

Create a small simulation of the previous game (a main class) including the creation of
any character and making this to use two different weapons (the behaviour of the weapons
can be just a print out: i.e. “Shoot the revolver!”).
